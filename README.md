# web-scraping
In this tutorial, I will collect and parse a web page in order to grab textual data and write the information I have gathered to a CSV file. Using Python and Beautiful Soup to scrape data from a website. I stored the text that we gathered within a CSV file.

You can continue working on this project by collecting more data and making your CSV file more robust. For example, you may want to include the nationalities and years of each artist. You can also use what you have learned to scrape data from other websites.

## Requirements

```bash
Library beautifulsoup4
Library requests
Library csv
```
